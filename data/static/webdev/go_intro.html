    <p>Go is an open source programming language aimed at building simple, reliable, and efficient software.</p> <img

    <p>Go is a general purpose language designed at Google by Robert Griesmer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. The language
      is statically typed, explicit, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, with the added benefits of garbage
      collection and structural typing.</p>
    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
    <p>Go was designed in 2007 with the intention of improving productivity at Google. Go was first made publicly
      available in March 2012. Since such, it has become the fastest growing language on GitHub, as well as the highest
      paid programming language in 2018. Since Goâ€™s release, the language has seen many iterations, and as of March 2019
      the current release is Go 1.12, the twelfth public release.</p>
    <p>Rob Pike, best known for his work on Go and at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell
        Labs</a>,
      was also a member of the Unix team and was involved in the creation of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9</a> operating system. With Ken
      Thompson
      (another co-author of Go), he created the UTF-8 character encoding definition.</p>
    <p>Ken Thompson is considered a pioneer of computer science. Having worked at <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a> for most of his career, Thompson
      designed and
      implemented the original Unix operating system.</p>
    <p>Go is widely used in production at Google as well as many large organisations such as Apple, IBM, Dropbox,
      Netflix, BBC, Uber, Medium, Docker, SoundCloud, Cloudflare, Kubernetes, and many more.</p>
    <h2 id="Design">Design</h2>
    <p>The aim of the language was to solve problems specifically within Google, in an era of multicore, networked
      machines and extremely large codebases. The designers of Go wanted to address criticisms of other languages used
      at Google such as Python and C, while retaining their useful characteristics. This means Go is particularly suited
      to development on the web, processing huge volumes of data efficiently and with high performance.</p>
    <p>Go adopts characteristics from C++ and Java, such as static typing and run-time efficiency, as well
      characteristics from Python and JavaScript, such as readability and usability.</p>
    <h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>
    <p>Go modifies the syntax of C in an attempt to keep code concise and readable. Efforts have been made to make Go
      code minimal, as to reduce the potential risk of errors. Let's analyse some syntax features of a basic
      <code>if</code> statement in Go.</p>
    <p class="code-wrapper"> <code>if myInt > 5 { &nbsp;&nbsp;doSomething() }</code> </p>
    <p>The first notable feature is that there are no brackets around the conditional, contrasting the syntax of C.
      Secondly, the opening brace is written on the same line. In other languages, the programmer may choose to write
      the opening brace on the next line. Part of the appeal of Go is that all code is uniform and follows the same
      structural form. To achieve this, the Go formatter will ensure the opening brace remains on the same line, as in
      the example above. This makes working in a team or with others' code easier, as you know what to expect when
      reading it.</p>
    <p>Additionally, note the lack of statement terminator. Semi-colons <i>can</i> be used to terminate statements in
      Go, however the Go formatter will remove semi-colons in an effort to keep the code as uncluttered and as readable
      as possible.</p>
    <p>Similarly, round brackets <i>can</i> be written around the <code>if</code> statement conditional, however this
      too is removed by the Go formatter.</p>
    <p>With these small differences, code remains uniform, easy to read, and easy to write.</p>
    <h2 id="Go_Tools">Go Tools</h2>
    <p>Popular text editors and Go IDEs will implement the following Go tools, or offer an extension which facilitates
      them.</p>
    <p class="code-wrapper">
      <code>gocode: For auto-completion.<br>
        go-outline: For symbol search in the current file.<br>
        go-symbols: For symbol search in the current workspace.<br>
        gopkgs: For auto-completion of unimported packages.<br>
        guru: For the â€˜Find all referencesâ€™ feature.<br>
        gorename: For renaming symbols.<br>
        gofmt: For formatting code.<br>
        godef: For the â€˜Go to Definitionâ€™ feature.<br>
        godoc: For the documation when hovering over a symbol.<br>
        golint: For linting.<br>
        dlv: For debugging.</code>
    </p>
    <h2 id="Go_Commands">Go Commands</h2>
    <p>From the Go Docs:</p>
    <p>Usage:</p>
    <p class="code-wrapper">
      <code>go &lt;command&gt; [arguments]</code>
    </p>
    <p>The commands are:</p>
    <p class="code-wrapper">
      <code>bug: start a bug report<br>
        build: compile packages and dependencies<br>
        clean: remove object files and cached files<br>
        doc: show documentation for package or symbol<br>
        env: print Go environment information<br>
        fix: update packages to use new APIs<br>
        fmt: gofmt (reformat) package sources<br>
        generate: generate Go files by processing source<br>
        get: download and install packages and dependencies<br>
        install: compile and install packages and dependencies<br>
        list: list packages or modules<br>
        mod: module maintenance<br>
        run: compile and run Go program<br>
        test: test packages<br>
        tool: run specified go tool<br>
        version: print Go version<br>
        vet: report likely mistakes in packages</code>
    </p>
    <h2 id="Why_Go?">Why Go?</h2>
    <p>Go is embraced by many impactful and powerful organisations including Google, Apple, IBM, and those mentioned
      above.</p>
    <p>Go has solid credentials. It is financed by Google, and designed by pioneers in the computer science field.</p>
    <p>Go is open source.</p>
    <p>Go is fast, on a number of levels. Writing, compiling, and executing Go is designed to be quick and efficient.
    </p>
    <p>Go has fantastic support for concurrency, through the use of goroutines.</p>
    <p>Go is garbage collected. This has a significant improvement on performance and makes concurrency more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>Go has useful and helpful tools, which make development in Go fluid, and makes working with other Go code easier.
